#bers pro exploration

This repo explores the changes made to .ber file when actions have been taken in bers pro.

The first ~40 lines of .ber file are for project details, location info, building height info, climate info and etc.
Other changes made are hard to track since only plan numbers are used.

Things might be helpful at the moment:
- Update project info automatically
- Change window glass type automatically since they are noted as text rather than numbers



to be continued...
